- [ ] Real-time movie data (TMDB integration)
- [ ] Behavioral analysis & preference learning

### **3. Watchlist Management** 📝

```
Movie Browse → Add to Watchlist → Mark as Watched → Rate Movie
```

**Priority:** HIGH ⭐⭐⭐

- [ ] Add/remove from watchlist
- [ ] Mark movies as watched
- [ ] Rating system integration
- [ ] Watchlist filtering & sorting

### **4. AI Chat Interface** 🤖

```
User Message → AI Processing → Contextual Response → Movie Suggestions
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM ⭐⭐

## 🧪 **TESTING LAYERS**

### **Layer 1: Unit Tests** (Target: 85% coverage)

Focus on individual functions and components:

**API Routes:**

- [ ] `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- [ ] `/api/movies` - Movie data & search
- [ ] `/api/watchlist` - CRUD operations
- [ ] `/api/ai/*` - AI chat & recommendations

**Core Components:**

- [ ] `LoginForm` & `OtpForm` - Authentication
- [ ] `MovieGridCard` - Movie display
- [ ] `ChatInterface` - AI interaction
- [ ] `WatchlistCard` - Watchlist management

**Business Logic:**

- [ ] `movie-service.ts` - Movie data processing
- [ ] `behavioral-analysis.ts` - User insights
- [ ] `auth-server.ts` - Authentication logic
- [ ] Utility functions & validation

### **Layer 2: Integration Tests** (Target: 90% coverage)

Test component interactions and data flow:

**Critical Integrations:**

- [ ] Auth flow → Profile creation → Preferences
- [ ] Movie search → Recommendations → Watchlist
- [ ] AI chat → Preference extraction → Recommendations
- [ ] Database operations → UI updates

### **Layer 3: End-to-End Tests** (Target: 100% user journeys)

Test complete user workflows:

**Core Flows:**

- [ ] **New User Onboarding** (Email → OTP → Preferences → Dashboard)
- [ ] **Movie Discovery** (Search → View Details → Add to Watchlist)
- [ ] **AI Recommendations** (Chat → Get Suggestions → Watch Movie)
- [ ] **Watchlist Management** (Add → Mark Watched → Rate)

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests** (1-2 hours)

1. Fix 6 failing test suites to establish stable baseline
2. Update outdated component expectations
3. Fix mock configurations

### **Phase 2: API Route Coverage** (2-3 hours)

1. Test all authentication endpoints
2. Test movie search & recommendation APIs
3. Test watchlist CRUD operations
4. Test AI chat streaming

### **Phase 3: Component Coverage** (2-3 hours)

1. Test core dashboard components
2. Test movie browsing components
3. Test watchlist management components
4. Test AI chat interface

### **Phase 4: Integration Testing** (3-4 hours)

1. Test authentication → onboarding flow
2. Test movie discovery → watchlist flow
3. Test AI chat → recommendation flow
4. Test database → UI synchronization

### **Phase 5: E2E Automation** (2-3 hours)

1. Set up Playwright/Cypress for browser testing
2. Automate critical user journeys
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Set up CI/CD test automation
