# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived and deprecated documentation files that have been consolidated or replaced.

## Archived Files

### Tech Specifications (Consolidated → docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

- **`techspec.md`** - Original technical specification (Version 2.0)
- **`techspec_v2.2.md`** - Enhanced technical specification (Version 2.2)
- **`Tech Spec 1fc92ecba66c8081962ad8844e6036e0.md`** - Additional tech spec version (Version 2.0)

**Replacement:** These have been consolidated into [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) with comprehensive architecture diagrams and system design documentation.

### Environment Setup (Consolidated → docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

- **`setup-env.md`** - Basic environment setup instructions

**Replacement:** Content merged into [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](../docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) as the single source of truth for all setup instructions.

### Development Backups

- **`refactor-execution-plan.md.backup`** - Backup of refactor execution plan

**Replacement:** The current version remains at [docs/refactor-execution-plan.md](../docs/refactor-execution-plan.md).

## Current Documentation Structure

The documentation has been reorganized for better clarity and maintenance:

### Primary Documentation

- **[docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](../docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Complete setup and configuration guide
- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- **[README.md](../../README.md)** - Updated with new documentation structure

### Feature Documentation

- **[docs/AI_FEATURES_REQUIREMENTS.md](../docs/AI_FEATURES_REQUIREMENTS.md)** - AI system capabilities
- **[docs/AI_PROMPTS_REFERENCE.md](../docs/AI_PROMPTS_REFERENCE.md)** - AI prompt documentation
- **[docs/AUTH_SETUP.md](../docs/AUTH_SETUP.md)** - Authentication setup details

### Development

- **[docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md](../docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md)** - Latest development status
- **[docs/TEST_RESULTS.md](../docs/TEST_RESULTS.md)** - Test coverage and results

## Migration Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Environment setup consolidated in one comprehensive guide
2. **Visual Documentation**: Architecture diagrams with Mermaid for better understanding
3. **Cleaner Structure**: Reduced documentation redundancy and confusion
4. **Better Maintenance**: Centralized documentation updates and version control

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need to reference any archived content:

1. **Recent Content**: Check the replacement documentation first
2. **Historical Context**: Use `git log` to see the evolution of documentation
3. **Specific Versions**: Files in this archive contain the exact content as it existed

## Documentation Standards

Going forward, the documentation follows these principles:

- **Single source of truth** for each topic
- **Clear navigation** with cross-references
- **Visual aids** using Mermaid diagrams where helpful
- **Version control** through git rather than filename versioning
- **Comprehensive coverage** in fewer, well-organized files
