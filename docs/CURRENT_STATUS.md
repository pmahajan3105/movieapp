### 2025-01-27 Explanation System & UI Enhancements

‚Ä¢ Real Claude integration for recommendation explanations (cached per user/movie).
‚Ä¢ API `/api/movies` now always attaches `explanation` for authenticated users across legacy, real-time, smart, and behavioral paths.
‚Ä¢ UI
‚Äì `ConfidenceBadge` with colour-coded discovery factor.
‚Äì Hover pop-over (`ExplanationPopover`) shows full "Why this pick?" reason.
‚Ä¢ Shared `RecommendationExplanation` type in `src/types`.
‚Ä¢ Resilience: 5-second Claude timeout + per-user rate-limit (1/10 s).

COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Badge/popover integration in `WatchlistCard` and all movie grid components.
‚Ä¢ Batch explanation generation - single Claude call per movie list (reduced API costs).
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive test coverage: `ConfidenceBadge.test.tsx` + `ExplanationPopover.test.tsx`.
‚Ä¢ All movie pathways (behavioral, smart, realtime, legacy) use batched explanation generation.

SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL: Every authenticated user now sees confidence-based color badges with hover explanations across all movie recommendations.
